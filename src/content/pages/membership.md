title: Membership


The typical way to become a member of NVP is by registering for the Winter conference (and paying the membership fee at the same time). However, you can also become a member at any other time. In that case, contact the treasurer directly (see [about](/about) page).

Membership fees (for two years):

- For regular members: €25
- PhD students and honorary members (emeriti): €15
- For bachelor and master students: Free

If you want to subscribe to our mailinglist without becoming member, send an email to the secretary (see [about](/about) page).
