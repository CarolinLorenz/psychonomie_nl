## NVP: The Dutch Society for Brain and Cognition

The Netherlands has a rich history when it comes to the scientific study of mind, brain, and behavior (psychonomics). At the end of the nineteenth century, the first psychological laboratories were founded by Franciscus Donders in Utrecht and Gerard Heymans in Groningen. In these laboratories, Donders and Heymans conducted groundbreaking studies; many of these are still the basis of research that is done today. In 1968, the *Stichting voor Psychonomie* (Psychonomic Foundation) was founded. In 1985, this evolved into the *Nederlandse Verening voor Psychonomie* (Dutch Society for Psychonomics, or: Dutch Society for Brain and Cogntion). To its members, the society is best known by its abbreviation: *NVP*.

NVP aims to promote research on brain and cognition in the Netherlands and (from our perspective) abroad. Anyone with an interest in research on brain and cognition can become a member. But the focus of the society is on active researchers as well as on students with an interest in research.

The most important activity of NVP is the organization of the NVP Winter Conference, which takes place once every two years. In addition, NVP organizes specialist courses for researchers. And NVP engages with the Dutch government, funding agencies, and like-minded societies from other fields and countries, always with the aim to promote research on brain and cognition in every possible way.
