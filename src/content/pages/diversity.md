title: Diversity and inclusion

NVP is committed to work for inclusion, equity and diversity in our field. We recognize that racism and other forms of discrimination damage and limit scientific careers. In addition, they limit scientific progress by reducing the diversity of unique and varied perspectives that make up science.

The below listed internet resources provide information to enhance diversity and mitigate implicit bias in our field and science more generally. 


__Resources to mitigate implicit bias__:

- [Concrete Steps for Recruiting, Supporting, and Advancing Underrepresented Minoritized Scientists](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ic6bil2AvrQmPFUcUyxcw_FumofKkUo3VLsU7qG0cTk/edit)
